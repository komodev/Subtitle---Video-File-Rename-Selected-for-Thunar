# Subtitle and Video File Rename **`#!/bin/bash`** Script in 1-Click -->




### Bash Script written for Thunar(Custom Action Option) & XFCE Graphic Environment, place it inside your `/usr/bin/` user folder and call it from 'Custom Actions' *Command* `Value field` from anywhere on your system(tested).

### Example of my setup and some explanations with Tips & Tricks as asked from my friends to include here.


### HOWTO USE AND WHERE IT WORKS:

**Linux Systems who are using XFCE Graphic Environment(tested) Ubuntu, kUbuntu, xUbuntu(my choice), Mint, Debian(the great dad of all), Elementary OS, Cent OS etc.**

### Easy Steps to follow:

1. Just copy the file into your `/usr/bin/myScriptForSubsRename.sh` folder.
2. Go to Thunar aka. Default XFCE File Manager.
3. Pick **"Custom Action"** menu & choose option **ADD New action**
4. And now COPY your script to `/usr/bin/` or whatever folder you wanna save to so from Thunar with 1-Click and VOILA **it renamed both video+subtitle file exactly the same but extension stays original** for you by just selecting both of them and right-Click for a popup-menu chooser with action-commands that we customized and added to our File Manager in 2mins. so your TV is not gonna be as picky as usual like my Sony Vaio(basterd needs same fileName for both video+subv or never loads subs so I decided to do 50-60 lines of code and finish my `copy/paste` on a daily basis(God forbid Game of Thrones goes Season 8 !@#$%T^Y&) that wife and I did practice for a long time when Copy of 30 films onto USB Stick needs to have another 30 subs with exactly SameFileName just different Extension - or our and many more TV's I know at friends - not gonna load at all so practicly FILM/MOVIE/VIDEO & SUBTITLE MUST BE EXACTLY SAME NAME with their original extensions(avi, mp4, mkv, sub, srt, txt etc.).
5. In the `Thunar Custom Action MENU` at **Name field** - write(your Script Name will be shown as an OPTION from rightlClick Menu in Thunar) for example **SUB & Film Rename** or **Rename Sub file as film** or **Movie-SUB renamer** whatever you prefer, fill up the description as you like, and in "Command field enter the location where you stored the script you downloaded.
for example I saved mine in `/usr/bin/subrenamerScript.sh`.

### NOTE: Tested on few Linux distros based & derived from Debian, so Ubuntu, xUbuntu, elementary, Debian itself, Mint and few more are tested, running on XFCE of course, different Distros using XFCE should be also friendly but some Linux systems are not like others and let me know if you stuck at any. I did not tried it just in Thunar File Manager working on Unity or GNOME Shell for example and not sure if that's even possible but if you bump on a chance, give it a try and pls send over your feedback.


### If you need more extensions for both VIDEO and SUBTITLE fileFormats, feel free to open an Issue or ask for
