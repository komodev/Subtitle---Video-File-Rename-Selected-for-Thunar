# Subtitle and Video Files Renaming Script  -->
made for Thunar(Custom Action - Bash Script) & XFCE Graphic Environment.


## **HOWTO USE: = Linux Ubuntu, kUbuntu, xUbuntu(my choice), Mint, Debian(the great dad of all), Elementary OS etc. and XFCE as Graphic Environment**


1. Just copy the file into your **usr/bin/** folder.
2. Go to Thunar aka. Default XFCE File Manager.
3. Pick **"Custom Action"** menu & choose go **ADD New action**
4. And now COPY your script into **/usr/bin** or whatever folder you wanna save to so from Thunar with 1-Click and VOILA *it renamed both video+subtitle file* for you by just selecting both of them and rightclick for a popup-menu chooser with action-commands that we customized and added to our File Manager in 2mins. so your TV is not gonna be as picky as usual like my Sony Vaio(basterd needs same fileName for both video+subv or never loads subs so I decided to do 50 lines of code and finish my copy/paste that wife and I did practice from time to time when Copy of 30 films needs to have another 30 subs with sameFileName just different Extension.
5. In Name field - write(your Script Name shown from rightlclick Menu in Thunar) for example **SUB & Film Renamer** fill up the description as you like, and in ** "Command field enter the location where you stored the script you downloaded.
for example I saved mine in usr/bin/subrename.sh" **


NOTE: Tested on few Linux distros based & derived from Debian, so Ubuntu, xUbuntu, elementary, Debian itself, Mint and few more are tested, running on XFCE of course, different Distros using XFCE should be also friendly but some Linux systems are not like others and let me know if you stuck at any. I did not tried it just in Thunar File Manager working on Unity or GNOME Shell for example and not sure if that's even possible but if you bump on a chance, give it a try and pls send over your feedback
